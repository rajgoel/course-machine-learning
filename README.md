## Grading

Grading will be based to 100% on project work.

## Bonus

A bonus of up to **1.0 point on the final course grade** can be obtained by meaningful contribution to the course materials. 

## Module description

This module, which builds up on the module “Fundamentals of Data Science”, introduces neural networks and how they can be used within machine learning. It provides hands on exercises developing classification and regression with neural networks. Moreover students will learn how to use reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning.

### Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module, the students will be able to:

- understand and apply deep learning architectures, enabling them to build
and evaluate predictive models for diverse applications
- know how systematically select, evaluate, and improve deep learning
architectures
- use deep learning for a wide range of tasks including, prediction and
classification
